# Escapade

Escapade is a new dating app experience built using Sui, zkLogin, and Enoki.

Users get matched with others based on their activity preferences. We then automatically plan a date at a participating local business.

Local businesses issue tokens that can be redeemed for freebies. We drive business to local venues, and in return, they offer freebies to daters who send to them.

The app uses Enoki to authenticate the user to allow seamless transactions on Sui. It also allows businesses to mint tokens which can then be transferred to users.

We also use Enoki's sponsored transactions to facilitate the transfer of tokens.

## The problem, the solution, and technical implementation

Current dating apps are terrible! They are filled with fake accounts and only serve to keep people constantly swiping. What if there was a way to mitigate spam accounts, and also create a dating experience that rewards daters and local businesses through the use of redeemable, verifiable tokens?

Escapade is a new take on dating apps that emphasizes in-person meetups and activities. Using zkLogin, users can quickly and easily sign up for an account with any Web 2.0 account. Once we discover activities that the user enjoys (such as wine tasting, bowling, coffee, etc), we automatically pair two users with common interests and schedule a date at a local business - all in one tap. Once both daters accept the date location, local business owners can then issue tokens which can be redeemable for freebies. Escapade helps to promote and drive business to local venues, which in return, provide incentives to our users.

We empower local businesses to issue tokens on Sui. Our demo shows how CRU Wine Bar can offer $CRU tokens to daters that can be redeemed for a free glass of wine. The tokens are burned, and the wine is redeemed. 

We believe Web3 provides a unique opportunity to fix some of the common problems with dating apps, such as the proliferation of fake / spam accounts. By introducing a layer of authenticity, we can offer high-quality matches to prospective daters, and drive revenue to local businesses. 

Sui's zkLogin removes many of the barriers that others have faced when trying to create a blockchain-powered Web3 app. Escapade promises to deliver an easy-to-use experience that ultimately will be very fun for our users, and offers an opportunity for those not familiar with Web3 tech to try something new and exciting.
