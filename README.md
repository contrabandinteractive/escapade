# Escapade

Escapade is a new dating app experience built using Sui, zkLogin, and Enoki.

Users get matched with others based on their activity preferences. We then automatically plan a date at a participating local business.

Local businesses issue tokens that can be redeemed for freebies. We drive business to local venues, and in return, they offer freebies to daters who send to them.

The app uses Enoki to authenticate the user to allow seamless transactions on Sui. It also allows businesses to mint tokens which can then be transferred to users.

We also use Enoki's sponsored transactions to facilitate the transfer of tokens.
